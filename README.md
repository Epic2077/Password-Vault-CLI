# 🔐 Vault CLI – Node.js Password Manager

Vault CLI is a secure and simple password manager built with Node.js. It allows you to:

- Set and verify a **master password** to protect your vault.
- Add, encrypt, and store passwords with identifiable names.
- View stored passwords by selecting from a list.
- Use encryption for secure local storage.

## 🛠 Features

- Master password protection (hashed using bcrypt)
- AES-256 encryption for stored passwords
- Easy-to-use CLI interface with [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- Fully local and offline – no data leaves your machine

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Epic2077/Password-Vault-CLI.git
cd vault-cli
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Usage

Start the CLI tool:

```bash
node index.js
```

### On First Run

- You'll be prompted to set a master password
- This master password cannot be recovered - remember it!
- a `vault.config.json` and `vault.json` file will be created.

### On Subsequent Runs

- You'll be prompted to enter your master password to unlock the vault.

## 🔧 Commands (via prompts)

- `Add New Password`: Add a new password by assigning it a name.
- `Add Password`: View stored password names and reveal one by selecting it.
- `Exit`: Exit the application.

## 📁 File Structure

```pgsql
vault-cli/
├── encrypt.js          # Handles encryption and decryption
├── index.js            # Main CLI logic
├── vault.config.json   # Stores hashed master password and encryption key
├── vault.json          # Stores encrypted password entries
└── package.json
```

## 🔒 Security

- Passwords are encrypted using AES-256 with a randomly generated key.
- The encryption key is stored alongside the hashed master password, so do not share your vault files.
- All data stays local to your machine.
